# GlassfishBookExamples
I was learning Java EE by reading the book of David R. Heffelfinger - Java EE 6 with GlassFish 3 - 2013 and coding all the examples supplied in the book.

At first i was using GlassFish server as it was suggested by the book author, but afterwards I decided to use wildfly server since it looks more popular in the community and more robust.

All code here is executable and works fine at wildfly-18.0.0.Final application server.
